# Wordle Solver
A command-line wordle reimplementation and solving platform.

The aim is to define an efficient representation of the game state so that it can be passed to an arbitrary solver. Ideally anything from a heuristic search to a genetic algorithm.

Includes a basic reimplementation of the game and a simple heuristic solver that can be used to solve most wordle puzzles.




## TODO
- Input checking and sanitation
- Play with solver (mode 3)
- Concrete KnownInfo representation for easier solver implementation
- snake_case names
- Package as module
- Tests
